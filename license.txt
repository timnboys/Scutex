Privacy Policy


I.	The Type of Information Collected
The Type of Information Collected is basically just your name only and well your email since it is send when you send your email so the email server knows how to reply back with your free key or increased violation limit free key, we do keep archives of emails asking for license keys or increasing violation limit requests, and also support emails, but they are highly secured in an email account that no one but KeyedInSoftware has access to, And they aren’t used very much after they are responded back to, they are only kept for archival purposes to see when someone emails us asking for a new license key, or increase in their violation limits. But otherwise the emails are stored securely in an email account that no one but KeyedInSoftware has access to.


II.	 Intended Use
This information that is collected, is used to perform your get free license key request or your get free violation limit increase request. It isn’t used after that except to check to see if you already have a key, if you send for a new one. Otherwise the data you send to us is kept inside a very secure email account, which no one has access to but KeyedInSoftware for archival purposes only.

III.	 How the Privacy Policy may be changed
This privacy policy cannot be changed without prior authorization of KeyedInSoftware, and also will not be changed often, due to we don’t like changing stuff because it is too much hassle to change. Anyway the privacy policy cannot be changed without alerting people on our website, specifically on the homepage so check back once in a while to see if it has changed (an announcement would announce this) which won’t be often, because we don’t really need to change it often due to how we do business, so since this privacy policy is already written, we will not change it often, so please don’t expect this privacy policy to be changed, often because if any at all changes need to be made to this privacy policy, we will do it only when needed, which isn’t often, because we don’t really need to change it much, because it is pretty current as of right now. 


IV.	 How a User may request to correct or remove their data

Please email us at support@keyedinsoftware.us, to request that your data be corrected, or removed, which correcting it really isn’t possible due to it is an email you cannot correct an email, but you can request to have your data removed by emailing us at the above email address, with the subject “Data Removal Request” and also if possible please tell us something to look you up in our secure email account, so that we may purge all of your emails in that secure account.
